 # Alice downloads the contact tracing app and launches it.

 She then locks her phone and goes about her day, as usual. Her smartphone will take care of the rest.

 The app creates a random, unique **pseudonym** for Alice, that cannot be traced back to her. Using bluetooth signals, it broadcasts her pseudonym to everyone nearby, like a beacon. In turn, the app logs whatever pseudonyms it receives.

 **Every few minutes her phone generates a new random pseudonym**. It is impossible to link them back to Alice, as they are random. Or track Aliceâ€™s pseudonym, as it is always changing.
 
 Aside from Alice's pseudonym, **no information ever leaves Aliceâ€™s phone without her express permission.**
