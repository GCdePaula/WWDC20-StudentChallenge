 # Privacy is achieved through decentralization.

 Knowledge is spread throughout the system, in a way that no one has the full picture and each one knows what they need to know.

 Alice and Bob are complete strangers, and will remain so. Yet Alice will know if she has ever come into contact with Bob, without discovering his identity.
 
 Even the central database knows nothing. For the database, the data is gibberish that will only become knowledge in the right hands.

 No trust or secrecy is required to preserve privacy. The system is robust in that all private information is *unknowable*.
