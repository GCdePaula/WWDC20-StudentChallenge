 # We are facing the crisis of the century.

 The coronavirus pandemic has had a profound impact in our everyday lives, and will shape the decades to come.

 **Automated Contact Tracing** is a hot topic at the moment. Smartphones are a central part of everyday life, and can be used to automatically trace who we’ve come into contact with.

 **The issue, however, is that such a system has the incredible potential to harm our privacy.**

 In this Playground Book, we’ll go through the basics of a simplified **Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing** system. We’ll be basing it on the east coast **PACT** and **ROBERT** protocols.

 Alice (👩‍🦰) will be our dashing protagonist, along with her sidekick Bob (👱‍♂️), showing us how to fight this pandemic with contact tracing. And how it can be done effectively while still protecting our privacy.
